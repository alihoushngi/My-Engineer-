# Architecture

Rulebook for the Mohandes Man frontend. Follow these rules in human and AI-assisted changes unless a later task explicitly changes the architecture.

## Purpose

This frontend is a Next.js App Router application. The first phase establishes structure, not product features. Architecture exists to keep routes thin, server rendering the default, and domain UI isolated from primitives.

Product routes, layouts, and domain component maps are specified in:

- [INFORMATION-ARCHITECTURE.md](INFORMATION-ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [COMPONENT-ARCHITECTURE.md](COMPONENT-ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [STATE-MATRIX.md](STATE-MATRIX.md)

## No `src/` directory

Application code lives at the repository root. Routes belong in `app/`. Do not create `src/`.

## Pages stay thin

`app/**/page.tsx` files are composition roots.

They may:

- read route params and search params
- fetch data on the server
- compose layout and feature components
- wrap sections in `Suspense`

They must not:

- contain large JSX implementations
- define domain UI inline
- own form state, drawers, tables, or cards that belong in `components/store/`

Thin pages make routes easy to scan and keep UI reusable across routes.

## Server Components by default

Every component is a Server Component unless it needs client capabilities.

Server Components can:

- fetch data on the server
- read secrets that are not `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`
- render Client Components as children
- reduce JavaScript shipped to the browser

## When Client Components are appropriate

Add `"use client"` only when the module needs at least one of:

- event handlers (`onClick`, `onChange`, `onSubmit`)
- React state or effects (`useState`, `useReducer`, `useEffect`)
- browser-only APIs (`window`, `document`, `localStorage`)
- client libraries such as TanStack Query or React Hook Form

Do not mark a parent as a Client Component just because one child needs interactivity. Split the interactive leaf instead.

The root `app/layout.tsx` must remain a Server Component. Compose client providers under `providers/` and import them from the layout.

## Folder responsibilities

### `app/`

Routes, layouts, loading UI, error UI, and Route Handlers. Nothing else.

Route groups:

- `(auth)` — authentication and expert-registration routes
- `(shop)` — storefront routes
- `(engineer)` — private specialist workspace at `/engineer`
- `(account)` — private customer workspace at `/account`

Route names are kebab-case. Dynamic segments use `[id]` for opaque identity (experts). Public SEO resources use `[slug]` or `[category]` (services, articles, FAQ, knowledge). See [INFORMATION-ARCHITECTURE.md](INFORMATION-ARCHITECTURE.md).

### `components/ui/`

Design-system primitives only: Button, Input, Textarea, Checkbox, Modal, Skeleton, Spinner, and similar.

Do not place feature screens, store cards, headers, or page sections here.

### `components/layout/`

Global application chrome: header, footer, navigation, search shell, and layout-related UI.

### `components/common/`

Reusable UI that is not a primitive and does not belong to one business domain.

### `components/store/`

All store/domain feature UI.

Feature UI path:

```text
components/store/<feature>/<componentName>/<componentName>.tsx
```

Examples:

```text
components/store/home/homeHero/homeHero.tsx
components/store/expert/expertCard/expertCard.tsx
```

### `hooks/`

Reusable React hooks. One kebab-case folder per hook.

### `lib/`

Pure utilities, helpers, and framework-independent infrastructure. One kebab-case folder per module.

`cn()` lives at `lib/utils/cn/cn.ts` and is the shared className helper.

### `services/`

External/server integration and domain API access. Services call APIs. They do not render UI.

### `providers/`

React providers. Query setup lives in `providers/query-provider/`. Application-level composition lives in `providers/app-provider/`.

Do not put application-specific queries inside the query provider.

### `config/`

Static application configuration. One kebab-case folder per config module.

### `types/`

Shared cross-feature TypeScript domain types. Store types belong in `types/store/*.types.ts`.

Component-specific types stay next to the component:

```text
components/store/cartDrawer/type/cartDrawer.types.ts
```

### `css/`

Global styles only. `css/globals.css` is imported from `app/layout.tsx`. Do not scatter global CSS files.

### `i18n/`

Reserved for localization. Do not invent a translation system until that phase starts.

## Services vs lib

| `lib/`                                                     | `services/`                                |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Pure helpers, formatting, HTTP client plumbing, env access | Domain API functions (`getUser`, `signIn`) |
| Framework-independent when possible                        | Knows endpoints and response contracts     |
| No product workflow                                        | Orchestrates backend access                |

## Local component types vs shared types

- If a type is used by one component or feature, colocate it under that component’s `type/` folder.
- If a type is a shared domain contract used across features, put it in `types/store/`.
- Do not duplicate the same domain type in multiple component folders.

## No barrel files

Do not create `index.ts` or `index.tsx` re-export files.

Import the concrete module:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button/button";
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils/cn/cn";
```

Barrel files hide the real dependency graph, encourage circular imports, and conflict with the naming conventions in this project.

## Naming conventions

| Area       | Folder and file names        | Exports                     |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Components | camelCase                    | PascalCase                  |
| Hooks      | kebab-case folder per hook   | camelCase `use*`            |
| Lib        | kebab-case folder per module | camelCase functions         |
| Providers  | kebab-case                   | PascalCase                  |
| Config     | kebab-case                   | camelCase constants         |
| Services   | kebab-case                   | camelCase functions         |
| Routes     | kebab-case                   | default page/layout exports |

Wrong:

```text
components/store/cart-drawer.tsx
components/ui/Button.tsx
hooks/use-cart.ts
lib/cn.ts
```

## Path aliases

Use `@/*` for project-root imports. Prefer the alias over deep relative paths.

Next.js `agentRules` is disabled. Project rules live in `.cursor/rules/project-architecture.mdc`.

## Environment and API boundaries

- Read `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` from the environment.
- Do not hardcode production or test API origins.
- Use native fetch through `lib/api/http-client/http-client.ts`.
- Do not add Axios.
- Typed failures use `ApiError` from `lib/api/api-error/api-error.ts`.
- Keep types explicit at API boundaries.
- Do not use `any`, `@ts-ignore`, or unsafe assertions unless there is a documented technical reason.

## API strategy

Services own domain API operations. They call the HTTP client. They do not invent endpoints until a later task defines them.

The HTTP client:

- reads the origin from `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`
- supports GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE
- accepts headers, JSON bodies, query parameters, and `AbortSignal`
- throws `ApiError` for non-OK responses
- forwards Next.js fetch options (`cache`, `next.revalidate`, `next.tags`) when the caller provides them

Do not force one cache policy on every request. Server callers opt into caching per request. Client callers stay compatible with TanStack Query.

## Server data vs client data

Use Server Components and native fetch for data that can be loaded on the server.

Use TanStack Query when client-side server-state behavior is required:

- interactive refetch
- mutations
- polling
- client cache
- dependent interactive requests

Do not put every API request in TanStack Query.

## RTL and Persian

The application is Persian and RTL.

- `html` uses `lang="fa"` and `dir="rtl"`
- Kalameh (FaNum) is loaded locally with `next/font/local` and exposed as `--font-kalameh`
- Prefer logical CSS properties
- Do not set `dir` on individual components unless a nested LTR island is required

## Styling

- Tailwind CSS only for application styling.
- Use `cn()` from `lib/utils/cn/cn.ts` for conditional classes.
- Global tokens live in `css/globals.css`.
- Visual language, semantic tokens, and UI primitives are documented in [DESIGN-SYSTEM.md](DESIGN-SYSTEM.md). Domain components compose those primitives; they do not duplicate them.

## State

- Server Components and TanStack Query cover server state.
- Do not add Redux, Zustand, or other client stores unless a later task explicitly requires them.
- Colocate local UI state in the Client Component that needs it.

## Dependencies

Do not install new dependencies without a clear need. Do not introduce a UI framework without explicit permission.

## Changing this architecture

Do not change folder structure, naming conventions, or these rules unless a task explicitly instructs the change.
