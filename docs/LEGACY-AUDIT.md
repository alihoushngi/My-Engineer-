# Legacy Frontend Audit

## Purpose

The employer-provided legacy frontend is used as a:

- content reference
- product behavior reference
- flow reference

It is **not** a visual design target.

Phase 0 and TASK 00.5 already define architecture and the Mohandes Man design
system. This audit extracts product meaning from the legacy HTML/CSS/JS so later
implementation can rebuild a coherent storefront without copying Bootstrap
markup, IRANSansWeb, or legacy JavaScript.

**Legacy root (not in this repository):**
`/Users/ali/Desktop/Personal/Project/Mohandesi/New folder/`

The legacy tree is incomplete, duplicated, and partly placeholder-based. This
document classifies every finding as one of:

| Classification                 | Meaning                                                              |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SOURCE REQUIREMENT**         | Explicitly present in employer files                                 |
| **UX COMPLETION**              | Not completed in legacy, but required for a coherent user experience |
| **BUSINESS DECISION REQUIRED** | Cannot be determined safely from source                              |
| **LEGACY ISSUE**               | Broken, contradictory, duplicated, placeholder, or obsolete          |
| **TECHNICAL MIGRATION NOTE**   | Concern for later Next.js implementation, not a product invention    |

Do not treat a legacy `href` as an API contract. Do not invent backend rules,
ranking, or missing FAQ/knowledge copy.

Do not invent ranking, fuzzy matching, or backend search algorithms.

**TECHNICAL MIGRATION NOTE:** Compose the existing design-system Input + Sheet/Drawer.
Deduplicate the offcanvas currently copied onto seven pages.

## City Selection

Customer search city and registration city are **different product concepts**.
Do not force one component model onto both.

### Customer discovery city (`#cityCanvas` on home + services)

| Concern           | Legacy behavior                                                                     | Classification                                                      |

| Expert results    | Service pages show `.selectedCityDisplay`; default HTML `رشت`; count `23` is static | **SOURCE REQUIREMENT** (intent) / **LEGACY ISSUE** (no real filter) |

### Registration city (`auth/step3.html`)

| Concern      | Registration behavior                                                      | vs customer       |

| Primary city | **Single** required province + city                                        | Customer is multi |
| Nearby       | Optional multi-check, copy claims ~30 km radius                            | Customer has none |
| Persistence  | Form POST only; no `localStorage`                                          | Isolated          |
| Cascade      | Not implemented; nearby list is Gilan towns unrelated to selected province | **LEGACY ISSUE**  |

**BUSINESS DECISION REQUIRED:** customer match logic (AND/OR), max selected
cities, geolocation, whether changing city reloads expert results immediately.

**TECHNICAL MIGRATION NOTE:** two modes — discovery multi-select vs registration
primary + nearby.

## Service Discovery

Six pages share one product model: **choose a service → optionally set city and
filters → browse experts → open profile**.

Future implementation should use a reusable service-discovery architecture.
This task does not implement it.

### Shared model

| Block                    | Presence                      | Notes                                                 |

| Title / intro            | All; intro line on Gen A only | Shared intro about rated, identity-verified engineers |
| Search                   | All                           | Opens `#searchCanvas` (same shell as home)            |
| City                     | All                           | Opens `#cityCanvas`; display default `رشت`            |
| Filters                  | All                           | Chip row + offcanvas radios                           |
| Service-specific filters | Varies                        | Skill options often wrongly copied from surveying     |

| Result count             | All                           | Hardcoded `23 متخصص در دسته بندی زیر یافت شد`         |

Shared filter chips (when present): دسته بندی خدمات، سابقه کار، پروانه نظام
مهندسی، رشته تحصیلی، مدرک تحصیلی.

Shared JS: chip active state, radio → close offcanvas, remove filter, drawing
tabs, worker tabs. **Radios do not filter the listing.** Load more is unwired.

**TECHNICAL MIGRATION NOTE:** replace Bootstrap Offcanvas + body-class tabs
with Sheet/Drawer + Tabs + server-filtered lists.

Two visual generations exist (Gen A: surveying, workers, drawing; Gen B:
interior, permit, admin). Unify on the design system later — not a TASK 01
redesign.

### Expert Result Card

Do not create `ExpertCard` in this task.

| Field        | Consistent? | Evidence                                          |

| Review count | Yes         | `(12 نظر)`                                        |

| Avatar       | Yes         | Demo person image                                 |
| Name         | Varies      | Gen A `حمید جبلبی` (typo); Gen B `ابوذر حسن زاده` |
| Profession   | Yes         | `مهندس عمران` on every service — often wrong      |
| Specialties  | Varies      | Surveying chips on **all** pages                  |
| Experience   | Yes         | `تجربه : 10 سال`                                  |
| Verification | Yes         | `تایید شده`                                       |
| City         | Varies      | بندر انزلی vs بندر کیاشهر                         |
| CTA          | Yes         | `مشاهده پروفایل و تماس` → `/resume.html`          |

Suggested-expert card (surveying only): name, role, specialty, rating, review
count, `مشاهده پروفایل` → `#`.

Reusable implication: one listing card; optional suggested variant. Skills must
be service-contextual. Profile URL must become `/experts/[id]`.

### Land Surveying

Unique and appropriate content: UTM / شمیم / تفکیک skills, surveying accordion,
five real FAQs, suggested-expert rail. Experience filter is 3-band (0–5 / 5–15 /
15+), unlike the 4-band used elsewhere.

Skill typo: `نقشه بردای`. Radio values include leftover `steel` / `industrial`.
Suggested experts are four identical cards with `#` links.

**SOURCE REQUIREMENT** for this service’s identity and surveying FAQ copy.
Suggested-expert destination is **UX COMPLETION**.

### Construction Workers / Contractors

Tabs: `استادکار ساختمان` / `پیمانکار ساختمان`. Ostadkar omits license and
degree filters; peymankar includes them.

**LEGACY ISSUE:** skill options, accordion, FAQ bodies, and card skills are
surveying copy. Duplicate `#accordion-survey` ids. Meta mentions برق‌کار،
گچ‌کار، آجرکار — not in the skill list.

**BUSINESS DECISION REQUIRED:** taxonomy of worker vs contractor specialties;
whether tabs are subtypes of one route or two routes.

### Drawing

Tabs: معماری / سازه / برق / مکانیک (`darw-arc` typo ids). Only سازه shows a
skill chip (concrete / steel / industrial calculations).

**LEGACY ISSUE:** all four accordion/FAQ bodies are surveying UTM questions;
listing cards still show surveying skills. Malformed `og:url`.

**BUSINESS DECISION REQUIRED:** tabs vs nested routes; whether `محاسبات
ساختمان` is a drawing subtype or a seventh top-level service (it appears in
registration step 4 and search categories).

### Interior / Facade Design

Gen B. Combined category `طراحی داخلی - طراحی نما`. Info blocks use repeated
placeholder Persian. Skill filter and card skills are surveying.

**LEGACY ISSUE** (copied content + placeholder copy).
**BUSINESS DECISION REQUIRED:** one list vs facade/interior subtypes.

### Building Permit / Completion Certificate

Gen B. Category `پروانه ساخت-پایان کار`. **No no-result block** —
**UX COMPLETION**. Skill filter/cards are surveying. Info bodies are
placeholder.

### Administrative Services

Gen B. Meta mentions شهرداری، ثبت، بخشداری، بنیاد مسکن — not in filters.
Skill filter/cards are surveying. Placeholder info copy.

**BUSINESS DECISION REQUIRED:** admin sub-tracks.

### Surveying-content contamination

| Page            | Accordion   | FAQ / info  | Skill filter | Card skills |
| --------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Land surveying  | Intentional | Intentional | Intentional  | Intentional |
| Workers         | Copied      | Copied      | Copied       | Copied      |
| Drawing         | Copied      | Copied      | Calc options | Copied      |
| Interior        | Copied      | Placeholder | Copied       | Copied      |
| Building permit | Copied      | Placeholder | Copied       | Copied      |
| Administrative  | Copied      | Placeholder | Copied       | Copied      |

Copied surveying content on non-survey pages is a **LEGACY ISSUE**. Do not
fabricate replacement FAQ copy in this task.

### Missing profile states

Do not invent backend rules for those states.

---

## Expert Registration

Treat registration as **one wizard**, not nine unrelated pages. Legacy
implementation is nine HTML files plus `auth.js`. There is no shared client
store, step guard, or draft.

Laravel Blade placeholders (`{{ route('expert.register') }}`, `@csrf`) appear
in HTML. No backend lives in this tree. Validation observed here is
**client-side only**. Do not infer server rules.

### Step 1 — Identity

**File:** `auth/step1.html`  
**Purpose:** Collect Iranian mobile and national ID; imply terms acceptance;
warn that phone ownership must match national ID.

| Field           | Type | Required | Notes                                      |
| --------------- | ---- | -------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `mobile`        | tel  | Yes      | 11 digits, `09…`, digits-only sanitization |
| `national_code` | text | Yes      | 10 digits + Iranian checksum               |

Terms: no checkbox. Copy says filling the form accepts `../about-us/terms.html`.
**SOURCE REQUIREMENT.** Explicit checkbox is **BUSINESS DECISION REQUIRED**.

Phone-ownership warning is copy only. Shahkar-style match is
**BUSINESS DECISION REQUIRED**.

Client validation messages: required mobile, invalid mobile, required national
code, length, checksum (reject all-same-digit codes). `novalidate` on form.
Submit posts to `{{ route('expert.register') }}` — no next href.

**UX COMPLETION:** duplicate phone, duplicate national code, network error,
loading.

### Step 2 — OTP

**File:** `auth/step2.html` (inline script; `auth.js` unused here)

**SOURCE REQUIREMENT:** five digit-only boxes, autofocus, advance, Backspace to
previous, paste digits, 120s timer, submit requires `/^\d{5}$/`.

Displayed number is hardcoded `0911213232`. Form `action=""`.

| Control       | Problem                                                     | Classification    |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Resend        | After timer, `href="step3.html"` navigates to location step | **LEGACY ISSUE**  |
| Edit phone    | `href="#"`; no return to step 1                             | **UX COMPLETION** |
| Wrong/expired | No UI                                                       | **UX COMPLETION** |
| Resend API    | Does not exist; do not treat `step3.html` as resend design  | **LEGACY ISSUE**  |

### Step 3 — Service area

**File:** `auth/step3.html`

| Field             | Required | Notes                           |
| ----------------- | -------- | ------------------------------- |
| `province_id`     | Yes      | Sample East/West Azerbaijan     |
| `city_id`         | Yes      | Sample نقده / تبریز; no cascade |
| `nearby_cities[]` | No       | Five static Gilan towns         |

Copy: nearby cities within 30 km; “بدون محدودیت”. List does not depend on the
selected city. **LEGACY ISSUE.**

**BUSINESS DECISION REQUIRED:** exact radius, max nearby count, whether nearby
is optional, whether main city is included, reset-on-change.

POST has no `action`. Implied next is step 4. No back control.

### Step 4 — Expertise

**File:** `auth/step4.html`  
Major feature.

Conceptual relationship from **source only** (no invented IDs or schemas):

```text
ServiceCategory
  → Expertise (multi-select, `expertise_ids[]`)
  → Optional Software (category-scoped, `software_ids[]`, not nested under a single expertise)
```

| Category UI             | `data-category` | Software | Nested subcategory in UI |
| ----------------------- | --------------- | -------- | ------------------------ |
| نقشه برداری             | survey          | No       | No                       |
| دریافت پروانه ساخت      | licence         | No       | No                       |
| ترسیم نقشه              | drawing         | Yes      | No                       |
| محاسبات ساختمان         | calculate       | Yes      | No                       |
| استادکار ساختمان        | ostadkar        | No       | ساخت اسکلت بتنی          |
| پیمانکار ساختمان        | peymankar       | No       | عملیات خاکی و فونداسیون  |
| طراحی نما - طراحی داخلی | design          | Yes      | No                       |
| انجام خدمات اداری       | edari           | No       | No                       |

Expertise values 1–17 and 19–24 exist. **Value 18 is missing** — **LEGACY ISSUE**.
Ostadkar/peymankar trees show only one subcategory each —
**BUSINESS DECISION REQUIRED** (incomplete catalog?).
Licence vs edari overlap semantically — **BUSINESS DECISION REQUIRED**.

Software is optional and not coupled in JS to expertise. V-Ray value `6`
appears in both drawing and design. **BUSINESS DECISION REQUIRED:** may software
be submitted without an expertise in that category?

Confirm buttons only dismiss offcanvas. No minimum-expertise check.
Footer copy claims unlimited selection — **BUSINESS DECISION REQUIRED**.

POST `action="{{ route('...') }}"`.

### Step 5 — Personal information

**File:** `auth/step5.html`

| Field          | Required | Notes                                                      |
| -------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Expertise list | UI only  | Hardcoded sample items; remove / show more / count         |
| `first_name`   | Yes      |                                                            |
| `last_name`    | Yes      |                                                            |
| `national_id`  | Hidden   | Display `265646476`; Step 1 used `national_code`           |
| `province_id`  | Yes      | IDs `birthProvince` / `birthCity` but labels are work city |
| `city_id`      | Yes      | Different option values than step 3                        |
| `avatar`       | No       | Image preview; non-image silently cleared                  |

`#goToPreviousStepBtn` looks for same-document `.step-4` then `history.back()`
— does not go to `step4.html`. **LEGACY ISSUE.**

Duplicated location vs step 3 is a **LEGACY ISSUE** and
**BUSINESS DECISION REQUIRED** (confirmation vs birth place vs second source of
truth). Form `action=""`.

### Step 6 — Education

**File:** `auth/step6.html` + `auth.js`

| Branch           | Flow                                                                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `diplomaOrLower` | Skip degree cards → generate «دیپلم» upload                                          |
| `aboveDiploma`   | Multi-select کاردانی / کارشناسی / کارشناسی ارشد / دکتری → one upload card per degree |

Both card labels include «دیپلم» — likely a copy error (**LEGACY ISSUE** /
**BUSINESS DECISION REQUIRED**).

Uploads: `education_files[]` + hidden `education_degrees[]`,
`accept=".pdf,.jpg,.jpeg,.png"`. Files are **not** required in JS. Need ≥1
degree if above diploma (alert).

Continue on upload step is `type="button"` with **no handler** — dead end.
**LEGACY ISSUE** / **UX COMPLETION**. Mini 1–3 circles are education-only, not
the global wizard.

### Step 7 — Engineering organization

**File:** `auth/step7.html` + `auth.js`

Flow: member yes/no → if yes, membership number + has license yes/no → if
license yes, number, file, discipline, qualifications.

**Discipline → qualifications (source only):**

| Discipline                     | Qualifications               |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| omran, bargh, mechanic, memari | طراحی، نظارت، اجرا           |
| naghshe                        | طراحی، نظارت (no اجرا)       |
| traffic, shahrsazi             | Select exists; no UI options |

Do not expand those rules. ترافیک / شهرسازی qualifications are
**BUSINESS DECISION REQUIRED**.

Almost no `name` attributes — values live in JS variables only.
**TECHNICAL MIGRATION NOTE.** `hyrcan_validateNezam()` does not navigate on
success. **LEGACY ISSUE.**

### Step 8 — Professional resume

**File:** `auth/step8.html`

| Field              | Rule in `goToStepTwo` (unused on this page) |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| `experience_years` | Required, numeric, ≥ 0                      |
| `resume_text`      | Trimmed length ≥ 10                         |

Button is `type="submit"` to `/submit-resume` and does **not** call
`goToStepTwo`. `#resumeStepTwo` lives on step 9. **LEGACY ISSUE.**

**BUSINESS DECISION REQUIRED:** max years, max text, whether 0 years is allowed.

### Step 9 — Portfolio and certificates

**File:** `auth/step9.html`

- Multiple portfolio images, preview, remove, image-only, client-side dedupe.
- Certificate rows: title + file; add row; confirm builds preview; remove-by-index is fragile.
- `accept_rules` checkbox required.

| Card URLs              | `/article/utm-map-difference` style paths, not `sample-article.html`   | **LEGACY ISSUE** / **TECHNICAL MIGRATION NOTE**         |

Proposed content flow:

```text
Articles home → (search / category / sort)
  → all articles OR category listing
    → article detail
      → TOC / FAQs / related articles / category
      → CTA to related service
```

Do not invent article bodies. Demo cards repeat the same UTM title/image.

---

## FAQ

Landing filename `landig-faq.html` is a typo — **LEGACY ISSUE**.

| Category card          | Destination               | Status        |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------- |
| نقشه برداری-سند مالکیت | `faq-land-surveying.html` | Real page     |
| ترسیم نقشه ساختمان     | `#surveying-1`            | Dead fragment |
| استادکاری ساختمان      | `#surveying-1`            | Dead fragment |
| Remaining seven cards  | **no href**               | Incomplete    |

**Do not invent FAQ content for missing categories.** Only surveying has a
concrete category page (10 accordion items + CTA to land-surveying).

Related tags on the surveying page are `#`. Back link `FAQs.html` does not
exist. Ask-question button targets `#entryQuestion` missing on that page.
`lang="en"` on Persian page — **LEGACY ISSUE**.

A generic FAQ category route is the correct IA. Missing content must not be
fabricated.

---

## Knowledge Base

Expected conceptual flow:

```text
Knowledge → Category → Tips → More results → Related service
```

Landing: six teaser cards. Only surveying “نکات بیشتر” has a destination, and
it points at missing `knowledge-page.html` (real file is
`knowledge-surveying.html`). Other tip/expert links are `#`. Filter `<select>`
values are empty. Tip text is often mismatched to the badge —
**LEGACY ISSUE**.

Surveying list: breadcrumb all `#`; claims `۵۰ نکته` but renders 4; «مشاهده
نکات بیشتر» has no JS; sidebar categories `#` with static counts.

**UX COMPLETION:** search, load-more/pagination, empty/error.
**BUSINESS DECISION REQUIRED:** whether load more is page size or infinite
scroll; data source for counts.

---

## Engineering Forms

**File:** `knowledge/forms.html` (60 lines). Stub.

Present: title, unwired search, category select (duplicate `value="13"`),
partial province select (many empty values), one group «خدمات مهندسی» / «ثبت
نقشه», download **icon with no URL**.

Do not invent document metadata.

**UX COMPLETION** for later: loading, empty, error, unavailable file, search
no-hits.

**SOURCE REQUIREMENT:** the catalog concept (search + province + category +
named form + download). Data and files are not in this tree.

---

## About

**File:** `about-us/about-us.html`

Preserve employer meaning; do not rewrite copy in this task.

Structure: breadcrumb → H1/tagline (تخصص، شفافیت، ۱۶ سال تجربه) → چرا مهندس من
→ داستان از اجرا تا پلتفرم → چگونه کار می‌کند (جستجو → بررسی و مقایسه → ارتباط
مستقیم) → six service domains + CTAs → ارزش‌های سازمانی (شفافیت، تخصص‌گرایی،
ارتباط بدون واسطه).

**LEGACY ISSUE:** every service card description repeats surveying blurb;
typo `پبمانکار`; current breadcrumb crumb is `#`.

Service CTAs point at the six real service files.

---

## Terms + Privacy

### Terms (`about-us/terms.html`)

Breadcrumb home + `#`. H1 + acceptance intro. مواد 1–10: definitions, account,
use, fees/payment, platform liability, disputes, IP, UGC, account restriction,

## Legacy CSS / UI Audit

Do not list thousands of CSS rules.

**Legacy CSS is not part of the new design system.**

The new application must not import:

- Bootstrap CSS
- Bootstrap JS
- `main.css`
- `bss-overrides.css`
- `auth.js`
- `main.js`

unless an explicit future task reverses this decision.

Retheme only via `css/globals.css` tokens already defined in TASK 00.5.

## Future Component Candidates

Do **not** implement these in TASK 01. Do not duplicate TASK 00.5 primitives.

### Layout

- `StoreHeader` — brand, menu, specialist-join entry
- `StoreFooter` — service/content/legal/contact
- `MobileNavigation` — sheet menu with service and FAQ accordions
- `StoreBreadcrumb` — about, articles, FAQ, knowledge, legal

### Common

- `SectionHeader`
- `SearchSurface` — floating/offcanvas search shell
- `CitySelector` — discovery multi-select (not the same as registration location)
- `ContentHeader` — articles/FAQ/knowledge/forms titles + search
- `ContentCard` — generic cover + title + meta for articles/knowledge teasers
- `FaqAccordionList`
- `ServiceCategoryGrid`
- `LegalDocument` — terms/privacy long-form
- `Carousel` / `Slider` — banners, testimonials, knowledge tips

### Domain

- `ServiceCard` / `ServiceTile`
- `ExpertCard` / `ExpertList` / `SuggestedExpertCard`
- `FilterBar` / `FilterChip` / `FilterSheet`
- `ServiceDiscoveryLayout`
- `ServiceSubtypeTabs`
- `ExpertProfileHeader`
- `ExpertContactSheet`
- `ReviewCard` / `ReviewForm`
- `PortfolioGallery`
- `ArticleCard` / `ArticleToc`
- `KnowledgeCard` / `KnowledgeTipList`
- `EngineeringFormRow`
- `RegistrationWizard` / `RegistrationProgress`
- `ExpertisePicker` (category → expertise → optional software)
- `EducationStep` / `OrganizationStep` / `CertificateFields`

### UI primitives already available (TASK 00.5)

Button, Input, Textarea, Label, Field, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Select, Switch,
OtpInput, FileUpload, Badge, Avatar, Card, Separator, Skeleton, Spinner,
Progress, Alert, Empty, Dialog, Sheet, Drawer, Accordion, Tabs, Tooltip,
Popover, DropdownMenu.

Compose these. Do not restyle them to match Bootstrap.
