# Messaging

Shared customer ↔ engineer conversations. Both panels render opposite views
of the **same** `Conversation` and `Message` records. Do not maintain a second
chat catalog per panel.

Visual language follows [DESIGN-SYSTEM.md](DESIGN-SYSTEM.md). Architecture
follows [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md). Account and engineer shells stay
separate except for this shared domain.

## Domain model

Types: [`types/store/messaging.types.ts`](../types/store/messaging.types.ts)

### Conversation

| Field                                               | Meaning                                                  |
| --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`                                                | Stable conversation id                                   |
| `participants`                                      | Explicit `{ role, id, displayName, avatarSrc? }` entries |
| `relatedRequestId?`                                 | Optional linked `ServiceRequest`                         |
| `relatedServiceLabel?`                              | Display label for that request/service                   |
| `relatedEngineerId`                                 | Public expert id                                         |
| `relatedCustomerId`                                 | Customer account id (not a phone number)                 |
| `latestMessage?`                                    | Preview derived from the last stored message             |
| `unreadByRole`                                      | `{ user, engineer }` unread counts for list UI           |
| `createdAtLabel` / `updatedAtLabel` / `updatedAtMs` | Display + sort                                           |

### Message

| Field                            | Meaning                                                    |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`                             | Stable message id                                          |
| `conversationId`                 | Parent conversation                                        |
| `senderRole`                     | `"user"` or `"engineer"` — never inferred from bubble side |
| `senderId`                       | Actor id for that role                                     |
| `content`                        | Plain text only                                            |
| `createdAtLabel` / `createdAtMs` | Display + order                                            |
| `status`                         | `"sent"` for stored messages                               |

Failed sends are **not** stored as delivered. The composer keeps the text,
shows an error, and offers retry.

Read receipts are not a product contract. Unread is a per-role list badge
only. Opening a thread marks that viewer’s unread count to zero in mock mode.

---

## Roles

`ParticipantRole`: `user` | `engineer`.

Customer UI treats `senderRole === "user"` as own messages. Engineer UI treats
`senderRole === "engineer"` as own. Own bubbles use `self-start` in RTL. A
visually hidden sender label is included so placement is not the only cue.

---

## Routes

### Customer

| Path                                | Purpose                                          |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `/account/messages`                 | Conversation list (paginated when longer than 9) |
| `/account/messages/start?expertId=` | Open-or-create, then redirect to the thread      |
| `/account/messages/[id]`            | Thread + composer                                |

### Engineer

| Path                      | Purpose                                          |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `/engineer/messages`      | Conversation list (paginated when longer than 9) |
| `/engineer/messages/[id]` | Same conversation, opposite viewer               |

Canonical detail URLs always work. On `lg+`, the detail route may also show a
list sidebar. Mobile is list route → detail route, not a cramped split pane.

Guest «پیام به مهندس» on `/experts/[id]` goes to customer
`/login?next=/account/messages/start?expertId=…` — never `/engineer/login`.

---

## Request association

A conversation may point at `relatedRequestId` (for example
`conv-utm-niavaran` ↔ `req-utm-niavaran`). Request detail can open the
thread. Profile start does **not** create a new thread when a pair already
exists.

**Current mock uniqueness:** one conversation per
`(relatedCustomerId, relatedEngineerId)` pair.

**API CONTRACT REQUIRED / BUSINESS DECISION REQUIRED:** whether production
should use one thread per pair, or one thread per request.

---

## Mock behavior

Single seed catalog:

[`lib/mock-data/messaging-mock-data.ts`](../lib/mock-data/messaging-mock-data.ts)

Merge + mutations:

[`lib/messaging/messaging-store/messaging-store.ts`](../lib/messaging/messaging-store/messaging-store.ts)

Development overlay cookie: `mm_mock_conversations` (`MOCK_MESSAGING_COOKIE`).
HttpOnly, same-site, not production chat storage. It is **not** cleared on
customer ↔ engineer role switch so the mandatory E2E can inspect both sides
in one browser. Do not persist real production message bodies in
`localStorage` or other unsafe browser storage.

When mock user auth is on, send / mark-read / start succeed against this
overlay. When mock auth is off, mutations return unavailable. No Socket.IO,
WebSocket, Supabase realtime, or Firebase.

Reviews and notifications are separate shared domains. See
[USER-ACCOUNT.md](USER-ACCOUNT.md) and [ENGINEER-PANEL.md](ENGINEER-PANEL.md).
They must not be mixed with article comments.

Mandatory mock path:

1. Customer login (`09121112233` / OTP `654321` or password `user1234`)
2. `/experts/amirhossein-rostami` → «پیام به مهندس»
3. Existing thread `conv-utm-niavaran` opens (no duplicate)
4. Send «سلام»
5. Engineer login (`09115447316` / OTP `123456` or password `admin1234`)
6. `/engineer/messages` → same conversation
7. Same body appears as a customer (`senderRole: "user"`) message
8. Engineer replies
9. Customer account shows the reply

---

## API contracts

Do **not** invent endpoint paths in the frontend.

Workspace reads today:

- customer list/detail/messages via `getUserWorkspace` /
  `getUserConversation` / `getUserMessages`
- engineer list/detail/messages via `getEngineerWorkspace` /
  `getEngineerConversation` / `getEngineerMessages`

Integration-ready mutations in
[`services/messaging-service/messaging-service.ts`](../services/messaging-service/messaging-service.ts):

- `sendMessage({ conversationId, body })`
- `markConversationRead(conversationId)`
- `startOrOpenConversation(expertId)`

Backend must define:

- `listConversations` for the authenticated party
- `getConversation(id)` including messages (cursor/older-page, not numbered
  site pagination)
- `sendMessage`
- `markConversationRead`
- start/open uniqueness rules
- 401 vs 403 when the other role hits the wrong panel
- authorization so a user cannot read another customer’s thread (BOLA)

---

## Realtime limitations

The UI works with request/response only. `router.refresh()` after a successful
send. There is no live typing, presence, or push. Do not pretend otherwise.

---

## Privacy

Chat UI must not show:

- customer phone numbers (full or masked) as a chat identity
- engineer private credentials, national ID, raw document URLs, or session
  secrets

Customer display name and engineer public name/avatar are enough.

---

## Pagination

Conversation **lists** longer than 9 use the shared website pagination
control.

Message **history** does not. The thread shows a recent window and «پیام‌های
قدیمی‌تر» to reveal earlier messages in the loaded snapshot.

---

## Mobile composer

On a thread, account and engineer bottom navigation are hidden so the
composer stays reachable above the keyboard, PWA safe area, and home
indicator. Composer padding includes `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)`.

Attachments are out of scope.
