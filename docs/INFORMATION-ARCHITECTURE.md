# Information Architecture

Implementation blueprint for the Mohandes Man storefront. This document turns
[LEGACY-AUDIT.md](LEGACY-AUDIT.md), [PRODUCT-FLOWS.md](PRODUCT-FLOWS.md), and
[PHASE-1-SCOPE.md](PHASE-1-SCOPE.md) into a route, layout, and page-composition
contract.

It does **not** authorize product implementation in this task.

| **BUSINESS DECISION REQUIRED** | Cannot be decided from source                                   |
| **API CONTRACT REQUIRED**      | Backend path, payload, or pagination is unknown — do not invent |

## 1. Product model

Mohandes Man is a Persian, RTL, mobile-first storefront that helps customers
**find building specialists** and helps specialists **join the platform**.

Primary actors:

| Actor        | Goal                                           | Auth in Phase 1                                      |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Customer     | Discover a service, inspect an expert, contact | None. No customer account route                      |
| Specialist   | Complete the 9-step registration wizard        | Wizard-owned challenge (OTP), not a general auth app |
| Guest reader | Articles, FAQ, knowledge, about, legal         | Public                                               |

Product language is **متخصص / expert**, covering engineers, contractors, and
trades. Do not name routes or domain folders `engineer`.

There is **no standalone expert directory** in the legacy product. Experts
appear as **results of a service** (and, after UX completion, of search). Do
not create `/experts` as an index because a listing HTML file does not exist.

---

## 2. IA principles

1. Legacy HTML files are not a 1:1 route list. Consolidate duplicated templates.
2. One service-discovery architecture serves all six services.
3. Identity resources use `[id]`. Public SEO resources use `[slug]` or
   `[category]`.
4. City and filters on listing pages live in the **URL**, not `localStorage`
   alone ([PRODUCT-FLOWS.md](PRODUCT-FLOWS.md) migration note).
5. Customer city selection and registration service-area are **different
   products**. They do not share one component model.
6. Broken `#` links are not routes. Unmapped tiles are hidden or disabled until
   product maps them — never shipped as `href="#"`.
7. Do not invent FAQ, knowledge, article, or skill copy for contaminated pages.
8. Chat, save, share, review submission, customer accounts, payments, and
   engineering-forms download stay out of Phase 1 UI until confirmed
   ([PHASE-1-SCOPE.md](PHASE-1-SCOPE.md)).
9. `app/layout.tsx` remains a Server Component. Pages stay thin.

### 3.2 Routes that must not exist

| Tempting legacy mapping        | Decision                                                  |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/resume` or `/resume.html`    | Replace with `/experts/[id]`                              |
| One page per service HTML file | One `/services/[slug]` implementation                     |
| `/articles/all`                | Consolidated into `/articles`                             |
| `/article/[slug]` (singular)   | Use `/articles/[slug]`                                    |
| `/FAQs`, `/landig-faq`         | Use `/faq`                                                |
| `/knowledge-page`              | Use `/knowledge/[category]`                               |
| `/engineers/[id]`              | Foundation example only. Product route is `/experts/[id]` |
| `/sign-in`, `/verify-otp`      | Foundation examples. No customer auth route in Phase 1    |
| `/experts` index               | Not a legacy product surface                              |
| `/services/calculations`       | Do not add until taxonomy P0 is decided                   |
| Nested drawing URLs            | Tabs stay query params until product says otherwise       |
| Chat / saved-experts / account | No routes until confirmation                              |

## 4. Consolidation decisions

| Legacy files                                           | Modern model                                                                              | Why                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Six `services/*.html` (two visual generations)         | One route `/services/[slug]` + config-driven copy/filters/tabs                            | Same product: city + filters + expert list + profile. Unify on the design system. |
| `article-landing.html` + `all-articles.html`           | `/articles`                                                                               | Same list surface; hub sections are composition, not a second route.              |
| `article-sum.html`                                     | `/articles/categories/[slug]`                                                             | Distinct category chrome/SEO.                                                     |
| `sample-article.html` + broken `/article/...` cards    | `/articles/[slug]`                                                                        | Canonical slug.                                                                   |
| `landig-faq.html` + `faq-land-surveying.html`          | `/faq` + `/faq/[category]`                                                                | Generic category route; do not invent other categories’ questions.                |
| `knowledge-category.html` + `knowledge-surveying.html` | `/knowledge` + `/knowledge/[category]`                                                    | Same as FAQ.                                                                      |
| `auth/step1.html`–`step9.html`                         | Nested routes under `/expert-registration` with one wizard layout                         | One flow, shareable step URLs, shared chrome. See §8.                             |
| Search offcanvas copied onto seven pages               | One `SearchSurface` in store chrome + `/search` results                                   | Deduplicate; complete the missing results UX.                                     |
| City offcanvas copied onto seven pages                 | One `CitySelector` overlay                                                                | Deduplicate.                                                                      |
| Popular services / drawing tiles / footer contractors  | Config-mapped links into existing service routes + optional `tab` query; hide if unmapped | Do not ship `#`.                                                                  |
| Home + profile review OTP modals                       | Not a route. Deferred with the review feature                                             | Customer auth model unresolved.                                                   |

**Tabs vs nested service routes:** workers (`استادکار` / `پیمانکار`) and drawing
(معماری / سازه / برق / مکانیک) stay on the parent service URL with `?tab=`.
Do not create `/services/drawing/architecture` until product decides
([PRODUCT-FLOWS.md](PRODUCT-FLOWS.md) P0 taxonomy).

**محاسبات ساختمان:** appears in search and registration, not as a home tile.
**BUSINESS DECISION REQUIRED.** Do not add a seventh service route.

## 5. Service slug catalog

| Slug                      | Persian label           | Tabs (query `tab`, until nested routes are decided)           | Phase 1 |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `land-surveying`          | نقشه برداری             | None                                                          | CORE    |
| `construction-workers`    | استادکار و پیمانکار     | `trades` \| `contractors`                                     | CORE    |
| `drawing`                 | ترسیم نقشه              | `architecture` \| `structure` \| `electrical` \| `mechanical` | CORE    |
| `interior-design`         | طراحی نما و داخلی       | None until product splits facade/interior                     | CORE    |
| `building-permit`         | پروانه ساخت و پایان کار | None until product splits پروانه / پایان کار                  | CORE    |
| `administrative-services` | خدمات اداری             | None until product splits شهرداری / ثبت / بنیاد               | CORE    |

Tab values are URL tokens (LTR). Labels stay Persian in UI config.

Popular-service and drawing-consultation tiles must map onto these slugs
(and tabs) once product provides the mapping. **BUSINESS DECISION REQUIRED.**

**Wizard-gated** means the user may not skip ahead without proof that earlier
steps succeeded. Proof mechanism is **BUSINESS DECISION REQUIRED** /
**API CONTRACT REQUIRED** (session, signed cookie, or draft). Until that
contract exists, the wizard provider must still _attempt_ forward-guards in
the client and send users back to the first incomplete step.

**Search entry** remains a global overlay (`SearchSurface`): popular tags,
category grid, recent searches (**UX COMPLETION**), and submit. Submitting a
non-empty query navigates to `/search`. Choosing a known service category
navigates directly to `/services/[slug]` and does not require `/search`.

`محاسبات ساختمان` in the category grid is **unmapped** until taxonomy P0.

Do not keep the legacy bug where resend navigates to step 3.

## 8. Registration architecture decision

**Decision: hybrid nested routes** — one wizard layout, one route per step.

Rejected alternatives:

| Option                             | Rejected because                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Single route + internal step state | Browser Back does not match user expectation; OTP and success URLs disappear; refresh recovery is worse; nine large branches in one page |
| Nine unrelated top-level routes    | Duplicates chrome; no shared guard; same legacy failure mode                                                                             |
| Query-only `?step=` on one URL     | Weaker deep links; easier to spoof; worse analytics than real paths                                                                      |

Chosen:

```text
app/(auth)/layout.tsx
  └── app/(auth)/expert-registration/layout.tsx   ← Server layout wrapping a Client wizard provider
        ├── progress, title, children slot
        └── one page.tsx per step
```

Why this fits the criteria:

| Concern              | How the hybrid addresses it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Refresh / recovery   | Layout + provider stay mounted on client navigations. Full refresh needs draft/session — **BUSINESS DECISION REQUIRED** (P0). Architecture accepts a server/session draft when the API exists; until then, guard back to step 1 or last server-acknowledged step |
| Deep-linking         | URLs exist for support and analytics. Forward skips are blocked without proof                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Browser Back/Forward | Native. Back from OTP → identity is correct; Back from step 4 → 3 is correct                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Mobile UX            | Sticky progress + sticky back/continue; no full store chrome; one focused column                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Validation           | Zod + RHF **per step**. Wizard context stores **committed** values only after the step succeeds (client schema, then API when contracted)                                                                                                                        |
| Maintainability      | Thin pages; shared nav/progress; no duplicated next/back logic                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

**State ownership** (no Redux/Zustand):

1. `RegistrationWizardProvider` (Client) in the wizard layout — committed step data, current allowed step, submission flags.
2. Each step page — `useForm` with `defaultValues` from the provider.
3. Server session / draft API — **API CONTRACT REQUIRED**. When it exists, the layout hydrates the provider from the server.

**OTP** is a route, not a modal: the SMS challenge is a primary task, needs the
timer, resend, and edit-phone flows, and must not sit under store chrome.

**Completion** is a route so success cannot be confused with a failed submit,
and so refresh does not resubmit step 9.

## 9. Layout architecture

Do not implement these files in this task.

### 9.1 Root layout — `app/layout.tsx`

|                  |                                                                                           |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Responsibility   | Document shell: `lang="fa"`, `dir="rtl"`, Kalameh, `globals.css`, `AppProvider`, metadata |
| Header / footer  | None                                                                                      |
| Container        | None                                                                                      |
| Server Component | **Must remain Server.** Already true                                                      |
| Owns             | Font variable, providers composition only                                                 |

### 9.2 Shop layout — `app/(shop)/layout.tsx`

|                  |                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Responsibility   | Public storefront chrome                                                                                                                |
| Header           | `StoreHeader`: brand, search trigger, city trigger, specialist-join, menu. Sticky. `glass-surface` allowed                              |
| Navigation       | Desktop: primary services + content as appropriate density; overflow in menu. Mobile: `MobileNavigation` Sheet                          |
| Footer           | `StoreFooter`: mapped service links, content, company, contact, legal. Hide social until URLs exist. Hide contractor links until mapped |
| Container        | `main` with skip link target `id="main-content"`. Pages choose `container-*`                                                            |
| Responsive       | Header compresses to icon triggers; footer stacks; safe-area padding                                                                    |
| Server Component | **Yes.** Header/footer split: server wrappers, client islands for menu/search/city                                                      |
| Owns             | Skip link, header, footer, shop `loading.tsx` / `error.tsx`                                                                             |

Home currently lives at `app/page.tsx` (Phase 0). Phase 1 must move it under
`(shop)` so it receives this chrome.

### 9.3 Auth layout — `app/(auth)/layout.tsx`

|                  |                                                                |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Responsibility   | Focused, non-store chrome for the wizard (and any future auth) |
| Header           | Compact: logo → `/`, optional “بازگشت به فروشگاه”              |
| Footer           | Minimal legal links to `/terms` and `/privacy-policy` only     |
| Navigation       | None of the shop menu / search / city                          |
| Container        | Centered `container-form`                                      |
| Responsive       | Full width on small screens with page padding                  |
| Server Component | **Yes**                                                        |

### 9.4 Registration layout — `app/(auth)/expert-registration/layout.tsx`

|                  |                                                                              |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Responsibility   | Wizard shell: progress, step heading, provider, children                     |
| Header           | Inherits auth; adds `RegistrationProgress`                                   |
| Footer           | Step navigation lives in the step UI (sticky on mobile), not the site footer |
| Server Component | Layout may be Server and render a Client `RegistrationShell` child           |

Complete step may hide back/continue and show a finished progress state.

### 9.5 Dev layout

Existing `app/dev/layout.tsx`. Not product. Keep out of shop navigation.

### 9.6 Layouts not created

| Idea                          | Why not                                                                                |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Separate legal Next.js layout | About/terms/privacy still need shop header/footer. Use `LegalPage` composition instead |
| Dashboard / account layout    | No customer panel in Phase 1                                                           |
| Chat layout                   | Feature not confirmed                                                                  |

## 10. URL and client state

| Concern                               | Source of truth                                            | Notes                                                                                                           |

| Discovery cities                      | Search params on `/services/[slug]` and `/search`          | IDs when API provides them — **API CONTRACT REQUIRED**. Do not keep names-only `localStorage` as the only store |
| City preference on Home               | Cookie or equivalent, applied when navigating to a service | **UX COMPLETION**. Optional `?cities=` on home is unnecessary                                                   |
| Filters, tab, page                    | Search params                                              | Shareable, SSR-friendly                                                                                         |

| UI overlays                           | Local component state                                      | Search, city, filters, gallery, contact, mobile menu                                                            |

Changing city on a service page **must refetch** the list (legacy did not).

| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

Do not invent endpoints, payloads, or ranking.

## 12. API integration boundaries (route level)

Follow [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md): `services/` own domain calls,
`lib/api/` is HTTP, `hooks/` wrap client server-state, `providers/query-provider`
stays generic.

| Domain                     | Likely service module                       | Server vs client                                                    | Loading/error owner                                                   |

| Search                     | `services/search-service`                   | `/search` page server-fetches; overlay suggestions client if needed | Page + `SearchResultsPage`                                            |
| Service listing            | `services/expert-service` (list by service) | Server Component for first paint; load-more may be client           | Route `loading.tsx` + list region                                     |
| Expert profile             | `services/expert-service`                   | Server Component                                                    | Route loading/error; `notFound()`                                     |
| Registration               | `services/registration-service`             | Client mutations per step                                           | Step + wizard alert                                                   |

Every module above is **API CONTRACT REQUIRED**. Do not create URL strings now.

TanStack Query is for: registration mutations, OTP resend, load-more append,
typeahead, client cache after interaction. It is **not** for about/legal or
the first SSR of a public profile.

## 13. Responsive architecture (IA level)

Breakpoints follow Tailwind. Design is mobile-first. Meaningful behaviors:

| Surface      | Mobile                                                                                                | Desktop                                                    |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Header       | Logo, search, city, menu. Join in menu + in-page CTAs                                                 | Search field, city label, join button, fuller nav          |
| Search       | `Drawer` full-screen or bottom sheet                                                                  | `Sheet` / large overlay. `glass-surface` allowed           |
| City         | Same overlay family; sticky confirm; search field                                                     | Wider two-pane province/city if needed                     |
| Service list | 1 column cards; horizontal filter chips; filter `Drawer`                                              | 2 columns optional; filter bar more visible                |
| Profile      | Sticky contact bar; stacked sections                                                                  | Side-by-side header meta; gallery grid                     |
| Registration | Sticky progress (step i of 9 + bar, not 9 overflowing dots); sticky back/continue; native file picker | Same column, more padding; sheets for expertise categories |
| Gallery      | Full-screen dialog, swipe **UX COMPLETION** if cheap                                                  | Dialog with next/prev                                      |
| Content      | Single column; TOC in flow                                                                            | Narrow measure; TOC may sit aside from `md:`               |
| Footer       | Stacked groups                                                                                        | Multi-column                                               |

Touch targets: default controls stay in the 44px class from the design system.

RTL: logical properties only. Nested `dir="ltr"` for OTP, phone, national ID,
and URLs.

Sticky header + sticky profile CTA + sticky registration nav must not stack
into an unusable content well. Profile sticky CTA is **only** on
`/experts/[id]`. Registration sticky nav is **only** in the auth wizard.

---

## 14. Accessibility architecture (IA level)

Component-level rules live in [COMPONENT-ARCHITECTURE.md](COMPONENT-ARCHITECTURE.md)
and [DESIGN-SYSTEM.md](DESIGN-SYSTEM.md). Route-level requirements:

- One `h1` per page (service title, expert name, article title, “ثبت‌نام متخصص”, etc.).
- Skip link as the first focusable control in the shop layout.
- Route `loading.tsx` sets a coherent pending UI; list regions use `aria-busy` when refetching.
- `error.tsx` offers retry and a path home; do not dump raw exceptions.
- `not-found.tsx` in Persian, with links to home and main services.
- Search results and expert counts announced via polite live region.
- Overlays (menu, search, city, filters, contact, gallery) use existing Dialog/Sheet/Drawer focus traps.
- Legal and article pages are real landmarks (`main`, `nav` breadcrumbs, `article`).
- Do not ship icon-only header controls without accessible names (`جستجو`, `انتخاب شهر`, `منو`).
- Reduced motion is global in `globals.css`; carousels must pause and must not auto-advance when reduced motion is set.

WCAG target: **AA**, matching the design-system primitives already shipped.

## 16. Phase 1 implementation sequence

Dependency order (documentation only):

1. **Foundation / design system** — done (Phase 0 / TASK 00.5).
2. **Move home under `(shop)`** and add shop + auth layouts, skip link, `not-found`.
3. **Chrome:** `StoreHeader`, `StoreFooter`, `MobileNavigation`, navigation config (only real hrefs).
4. **Legal/about** — static, unblocks footer. Task 01 slice 1; adjusted earlier than the generic “legal last” list because these pages have no API and make navigation honest.
5. **City selector + search surface** (overlays). City persistence + URL contract.
6. **Home** — static sections, mapped tiles, join CTA. Dynamic blocks behind data.
7. **Service discovery architecture** — one page, six slugs, filters, empty/error, `ExpertCard`.
8. **Expert profile + contact sheet**.
9. **Search results page** — after list/profile cards exist.
10. **Registration wizard** — shell, progress, steps 1–9, complete. Blocked on P0 product answers for draft/guards/location/taxonomy/completion redirect.
11. **Content routes** — articles / FAQ / knowledge if contracted, using only real copy.
12. **Engineering forms** — only if confirmed.
13. **Polish** — responsive QA, a11y pass, empty/error consistency, hide remaining gaps.

Slices 7–10 require APIs. Slice 11 requires a content-source decision.

## 18. Acceptance criteria (architecture)

```gherkin
Feature: Storefront information architecture
  Background:
    Given the design system primitives already exist
    And Task 01 audit, flows, and phase matrix are the product specification

  Scenario: Service pages share one route architecture
    Given six employer services
    When the storefront is implemented
    Then a single /services/[slug] page composition is used
    And no per-file Bootstrap template is reproduced

  Scenario: Experts are addressable
    When a customer opens a specialist from a listing
    Then the URL is /experts/[id]
    And /resume is not a product route

  Scenario: Search is completable
    When a customer submits a query
    Then they reach a results state (overlay completion or /search)
    And empty and error states exist
    And ranking is not invented client-side

  Scenario: Registration is one guarded wizard
    Given nine source steps plus a missing success state
    Then routes live under /expert-registration
    And resend OTP does not navigate to service-area
    And a complete route exists after successful submit

  Scenario: Broken legacy links are not shipped
    Then href="#" is not used as a product destination
    And unmapped tiles are omitted until product maps them

  Scenario: Unconfirmed features have no routes
    Then chat, saved experts, customer account, payments, and forms download
    are absent from the route map until confirmed
```
