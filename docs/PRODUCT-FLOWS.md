# Product Flows

Authoritative product navigation and flow specification for the Mohandes Man
frontend, derived from the employer legacy files and classified in
[LEGACY-AUDIT.md](LEGACY-AUDIT.md).

This document is the flow contract **before** implementation. It does not
create routes, domain components, or API clients.

Classification reminder: **SOURCE REQUIREMENT**, **UX COMPLETION**,
**BUSINESS DECISION REQUIRED**, **LEGACY ISSUE**, **TECHNICAL MIGRATION NOTE**.

## Find a Specialist Flow

Customer discovery is the primary storefront journey.

```text
Home
  → choose city (optional in legacy; default display "رشت")
  → choose or search a service
  → view service results
  → apply filters
  → inspect expert
  → contact expert
```

| Step             | Source evidence                                    | API needed | Notes                                       |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| No city selected | Trigger shows `انتخاب شهر`; pages still show `رشت` | Likely     | **LEGACY ISSUE**: hardcoded default         |
| Choose city      | Multi-select + `localStorage.selectedCities`       | Likely     | Names, not IDs, stored                      |
| Change city      | Display text updates; listing does **not** refetch | Yes        | **UX COMPLETION**: results must follow city |
| Choose service   | Six home tiles + menu                              | No         | Static IA                                   |
| Search           | Offcanvas shell; no results                        | Yes        | **UX COMPLETION**                           |
| View results     | Static demo cards, count `23`                      | Yes        |                                             |
| Filters          | Chips + radios; no listing effect                  | Yes        | **UX COMPLETION**                           |
| Clear filter     | Remove button restores chip chrome only            | Yes        |                                             |
| No result        | Copy + `تغییر شهر انتخابی` on 5/6 pages            | Likely     | Missing on building-permit                  |
| Load more        | Button, no JS                                      | Yes        | **UX COMPLETION**                           |
| Inspect expert   | `/resume.html` (no id)                             | Yes        |                                             |
| Loading / error  | Absent                                             | Yes        | **UX COMPLETION**                           |

**TECHNICAL MIGRATION NOTE:** city and filters must become query parameters or
server state. Do not keep `localStorage` as the only source of truth for SEO
service pages.

Inferred UX states (not in legacy, labeled **UX COMPLETION**): Edit phone
returning to step 1, resend that actually resends, expired/wrong OTP, upload
failure, network error, duplicate identity, completion screen.

Do not treat `step3.html` as resend. Do not invent the completion destination.

Back navigation, progress, drafts, and step guards are missing in source.

## Article Flow

```text
Home / Footer / Menu
  → Articles home
      → optional search / category / sort
      → all articles
      → OR category listing
          → article detail
              → table of contents
              → article FAQs
              → related articles
              → category browse
              → CTA to related service (surveying in the sample)
```

Landing, all-articles, and category listing are variants of one list surface.
Detail is a long-form reading page. Search/sort are unwired in legacy
(**UX COMPLETION**, API-dependent).

---

## FAQ Flow

```text
Home / Footer / Menu / service FAQ control
  → FAQ landing (category cards)
      → FAQ category page (accordion)
          → related service CTA
          → related categories
```

Only surveying currently has a category page. Other cards are `#`, missing
hrefs, or dead fragments. New IA should use a generic category route. Missing
category content must not be fabricated (**LEGACY ISSUE** + **SOURCE REQUIREMENT**
for content).

Ask-a-question modal is a shell — **BUSINESS DECISION REQUIRED**.

---

## Knowledge Flow

```text
Home carousel / Footer / Menu
  → Knowledge landing
      → Category
          → Tips
          → Load more
          → Related service CTA
```

Only surveying tips exist. Other categories are `#`. Load more is unwired.
**UX COMPLETION** for pagination; **BUSINESS DECISION REQUIRED** for remaining
categories’ content.

---

## Engineering Forms Flow

```text
Footer / Knowledge area (legacy file lives under knowledge/)
  → Engineering forms
      → search
      → province filter
      → category filter
      → named form
      → download
```

Legacy page is a stub (one row, icon without URL). Loading, empty, error, and
unavailable-file states are **UX COMPLETION**. Metadata must not be invented.

## Proposed Next.js Route Map

Follow established App Router rules: thin pages, groups `(auth)` and `(shop)`,
kebab-case. Do **not** create these files in TASK 01.

`docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` still shows example paths `sign-in` and `engineers/[id]`.
Those were foundation examples. Audited product language is **متخصص / expert**,
covering engineers, contractors, and trades. This map uses `experts`.

### Public storefront — `(shop)` and root

| Route                         | Product area             |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `/`                           | Home                     |
| `/services/[slug]`            | Service discovery        |
| `/experts/[id]`               | Expert profile           |
| `/articles`                   | Articles home / all      |
| `/articles/categories/[slug]` | Article category listing |
| `/articles/[slug]`            | Article detail           |
| `/faq`                        | FAQ landing              |
| `/faq/[category]`             | FAQ category             |
| `/knowledge`                  | Knowledge landing        |
| `/knowledge/[category]`       | Knowledge tips           |
| `/engineering-forms`          | Engineering forms        |
| `/about`                      | About                    |
| `/terms`                      | Terms                    |
| `/privacy-policy`             | Privacy                  |

Proposed service slugs (semantic, not legacy filenames):

| Slug                      | Service                 |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `land-surveying`          | نقشه برداری             |
| `construction-workers`    | استادکار و پیمانکار     |
| `drawing`                 | ترسیم نقشه              |
| `interior-design`         | طراحی نما و داخلی       |
| `building-permit`         | پروانه ساخت و پایان کار |
| `administrative-services` | خدمات اداری             |

Drawing/worker **tabs** stay as query or in-page tabs until product decides
nested routes. Do not add `/services/drawing/architecture` without a decision.

### Expert registration — `(auth)`

| Route                                           | Wizard step                               |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `/expert-registration`                          | 1 Identity                                |
| `/expert-registration/otp`                      | 2 OTP                                     |
| `/expert-registration/service-area`             | 3                                         |
| `/expert-registration/expertise`                | 4                                         |
| `/expert-registration/personal-info`            | 5                                         |
| `/expert-registration/education`                | 6                                         |
| `/expert-registration/engineering-organization` | 7                                         |
| `/expert-registration/professional-resume`      | 8                                         |
| `/expert-registration/portfolio`                | 9                                         |
| `/expert-registration/complete`                 | **UX COMPLETION** (no source destination) |

Query params (later, not invented APIs): service filters, city ids, article
sort. Registration should not be deep-linkable to later steps without
server/session proof — **BUSINESS DECISION REQUIRED**.

Customer login is **not** given a route here because legacy only shows OTP
modals on review/comment, while terms describe username/password accounts.

## Design System Relationship

TASK 00.5 primitives are the visual and accessibility source of truth. Domain
and layout components should **compose** them. Do not modify primitives because
legacy Bootstrap markup looks different. Do not import legacy CSS/JS.

| Legacy pattern             | Compose from                                         |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Modal / offcanvas          | `ResponsiveDialog` (Drawer on mobile)                |
| Form controls              | Field, Input, Textarea, Select, Checkbox, RadioGroup |
| OTP                        | OtpInput (`length={5}` for registration)             |
| Uploads                    | FileUpload                                           |
| Badges (فعال، تایید شده)   | Badge                                                |
| Avatar                     | Avatar                                               |
| Accordion FAQ              | Accordion                                            |
| Service / article tabs     | Tabs                                                 |
| Loading listing            | Skeleton / Spinner                                   |
| Empty expert/search result | Empty                                                |
| Progress (wizard)          | Progress                                             |
| Alerts / field errors      | Alert / Field error                                  |
| Expert/article surfaces    | Card                                                 |

Do not implement these compositions in TASK 01.

## Product Decisions Required

Only questions that cannot be answered from source.

### P0 — Blocks Implementation

1. **Registration completion destination.** There is no success page or redirect
   in source. Where does the specialist go after final submit?
2. **Registration draft and step guards.** Can users refresh, use browser Back,
   or skip to step 7? Is draft server-side, client-side, or none?
3. **Customer city matching rules.** Multi-select is in the UI, but AND/OR,
   maximum cities, and whether results load without a city are undefined.
4. **Search index.** Is global search services, experts, or both? Copy
   contradicts itself.
5. **Step 3 vs step 5 location.** Is personal-info location a confirmation, a
   second field (mislabelled birth), or a duplicate bug?
6. **Service taxonomy.** Is `محاسبات ساختمان` a seventh service? Are worker and
   drawing tabs subtypes or separate routes? What is the real skill catalog
   for non-survey services (legacy is cloned surveying)?

### P1 — Important Before Integration

1. **Customer account model.** Terms describe username/password accounts;
   review UI shows phone OTP (4 digits vs registration’s 5). Which is real?
2. **Review authentication and anonymity.** Implied but incomplete. Who may
   submit? Are home testimonials the same product as profile reviews?
3. **Chat scope.** Local mock only. Real-time? Attachments? Auth?
4. **Save / share scope.** Labels only. Auth? List of saved experts? Native
   share vs copy link?
5. **Nearby-city limits** for registration (radius, max, required?).
6. **Expertise catalog completeness** (missing value 18, thin trade trees,
   licence vs edari overlap, software-without-expertise).
7. **Education labels** (“دیپلم و بالاتر” vs above diploma) and whether files
   are required.
8. **Article/FAQ/knowledge/forms data source** and which categories actually
   have content.
9. **Forms download backend** (the page is a stub).
10. **Featured experts, banners, social URLs.**

### P2 — Can Be Deferred

1. Home article strip (not on the landing body).
2. Suggested-experts rail on every service.
3. Related articles on service pages (absent).
4. Cookie consent UI (privacy mentions cookies).
5. Payment, platform fees, complaint intake, account deletion — mentioned in
   legal text only. Do not add to Phase 1 unless contracted.
6. Exact banner click-through campaigns.
7. Geolocation “near me” (not in customer city UI).
