# Phase 1 Scope Matrix

Scope classification for rebuilding the Mohandes Man storefront from the
legacy audit. This is not an implementation task.

Every employer-supplied area is preserved in [LEGACY-AUDIT.md](LEGACY-AUDIT.md)
and [PRODUCT-FLOWS.md](PRODUCT-FLOWS.md). **Not every legacy control is
automatically Phase 1.**

## How to read this matrix

| Column               | Meaning                                                                    |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Area                 | Product area                                                               |
| Feature              | Concrete capability                                                        |
| Source Evidence      | Where it appears in the legacy tree                                        |
| Phase 1 Candidate    | **CORE PHASE 1** / **CONTENT SUPPORTING PHASE 1** / **NEEDS CONFIRMATION** |
| UX Completion Needed | Coherent UX missing in legacy                                              |
| API Needed           | Yes / No / Likely — **not** endpoint names (Swagger is a later task)       |
| Business Decision    | Yes if implementation cannot start safely                                  |
| Notes                | Constraints                                                                |

**CORE PHASE 1:** Strongly supported by the storefront purpose (find
specialists; specialists join) and by concrete legacy screens.

**CONTENT SUPPORTING PHASE 1:** Trust, SEO, and legal pages that support the
main product. Prefer read-only first.

**NEEDS CONFIRMATION:** Visible in legacy but not clearly contracted for a
full Phase 1 integration (chat, save, share, reviews, some content systems).

## Phase 1 reading of controversial features

These appear in legacy files and must not be silently dropped **or** silently
fully built:

| Feature           | Recommendation until product confirms                                                                             |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Chat              | Keep as a documented gap. Do not build messaging infrastructure in Phase 1 without confirmation.                  |
| Save expert       | Keep as a documented gap. Header affordance can wait.                                                             |
| Share             | Native share/copy is small if confirmed; not required to ship discovery.                                          |
| Reviews           | Display of ratings on cards is CORE if the API returns them. Submission + customer OTP is **NEEDS CONFIRMATION**. |
| Article system    | Read-only content routes are CONTENT SUPPORTING. Interactive search/sort can follow content API.                  |
| FAQ               | Landing + surveying category are CONTENT SUPPORTING. Other categories wait for content.                           |
| Knowledge         | Same pattern as FAQ.                                                                                              |
| Engineering forms | Treat as **NEEDS CONFIRMATION**; the legacy page is not a complete product.                                       |

## Suggested Phase 1 delivery slices (documentation only)

1. **Chrome:** header, footer, mobile nav, legal/about static pages.
2. **Discovery:** home + city + search shell + six service routes + expert card + profile (view + contact).
3. **Join:** registration wizard including completion UX, with P0 decisions resolved.
4. **Content (if contracted):** articles/FAQ/knowledge read paths using only existing copy.

Slices 2 and 3 require APIs. Slice 4 requires a content source decision.
