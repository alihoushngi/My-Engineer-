# State Matrix

UX-state architecture for interactive and data-driven surfaces.

This is not an API spec. Where the backend is unknown:

**BUSINESS DECISION REQUIRED** or **API CONTRACT REQUIRED**.

Visual treatment always uses design-system primitives: Skeleton, Spinner,
Progress, Empty, Alert, Field error, disabled Button.

## How to read a row

| Column            | Meaning                               |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Initial / loading | First paint or in-flight request      |
| Success           | Usable data or completed action       |
| Empty             | Successful response, nothing to show  |
| Error             | Request or action failed              |
| Retry             | How the user recovers                 |
| Disabled          | Control must not accept input         |
| Validation        | Field or step schema failure          |
| Partial           | Some sections present, others missing |
| Optimistic        | UI ahead of server — only if safe     |
| Mobile            | Differences from desktop              |

Do not invent toast copy, HTTP codes, or retry policies. Map server failures
when **API CONTRACT REQUIRED** is resolved.

## Global patterns

| Pattern                    | Rule                                                                                    |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Route first load           | `loading.tsx` + section Skeletons that match layout                                     |
| Route failure              | `error.tsx` + retry; Persian message; link home                                         |
| Missing entity             | `notFound()` — unknown slug/id/category                                                 |
| Refetch list (city/filter) | List region `aria-busy`; do not blank the whole shop chrome                             |
| Empty                      | `Empty` + one next action (change city, clear filters, browse services)                 |
| Mutation pending           | Disable submit; Spinner on the action; prevent double submit                            |
| Validation                 | Inline `Field` errors; focus first invalid                                              |
| Partial profile            | Hide the empty section; do not show “—” placeholders unless product asks                |
| Optimistic                 | **Not used** for registration, contact, or reviews until an API contract says otherwise |
| Reduced motion             | No carousel autoplay; timers still update text                                          |

## Search

Covers `SearchSurface` (entry) and `/search` (results).

| Mobile     | Drawer; sticky search field                                      | Same empty/error as listing                                                       |

Recent searches: **UX COMPLETION**. Persistence local vs server:
**BUSINESS DECISION REQUIRED**.

Copy conflict “خدمات و متخصصین” vs “خدمات، سرویس‌ها”:
**BUSINESS DECISION REQUIRED** (P0 search index).

## City selection (customer discovery)

Not registration step 3.

| State      | Behavior                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Initial    | Overlay closed. Trigger: `انتخاب شهر` or summary (`نام` / `N شهر`)                                                                                         |
| Loading    | City tree loading inside overlay (Skeleton accordion). **API CONTRACT REQUIRED** for full Iran dataset — do not ship the two-province sample as production |
| Success    | Provinces + cities; popular shortcuts work; search filters the tree                                                                                        |
| Empty      | Search with no city hits: empty inside overlay, keep popular/confirm                                                                                       |

| Disabled   | Confirm disabled when draft is empty **unless** product allows nationwide results without a city — **BUSINESS DECISION REQUIRED** (P0)                     |
| Validation | None beyond selection rules (max cities **BUSINESS DECISION REQUIRED**)                                                                                    |
| Partial    | Some provinces missing: show returned data; do not invent cities                                                                                           |
| Optimistic | Trigger label may update on confirm before navigation completes; listing must then refetch                                                                 |
| Mobile     | Sticky `تایید (N)`; chips wrap; search field at top                                                                                                        |

AND vs OR matching, max cities, results without a city: **BUSINESS DECISION REQUIRED**.

On listing pages, confirmed cities write search params and **must** refetch.
Home confirm writes a preference applied on the next service navigation.

## Service discovery

`/services/[slug]`

| State             | Behavior                                                                                                  |

| Success           | Count + list; filters reflect URL                                                                         |
| Empty             | Shared `ServiceEmptyState` (including building-permit). CTA: change city; secondary: clear filters if any |
| Error             | Alert in list region + retry; invalid slug → not found                                                    |

| Disabled          | Load more disabled while pending; filters disabled while first load                                       |
| Validation        | Unknown filter query: ignore or drop — **API CONTRACT REQUIRED**                                          |
| Partial           | Info/FAQ omitted when copy is not real; suggested rail omitted unless confirmed                           |
| Optimistic        | Chip can look selected as URL updates; list waits for data                                                |
| Mobile            | Sticky city/filter bar; load-more full width                                                              |

Tabs (workers, drawing): changing `tab` is a new listing request, with its
own loading/empty/error. Do not show surveying skills on other slugs.

Pagination: load-more button (legacy). Page vs cursor:
**API CONTRACT REQUIRED**. No infinite scroll until decided.

Live region: announce count on success (`N متخصص…`) once per completed fetch.

## Expert discovery (listing card)

There is no `/experts` index. This section is the card-in-list states.

| State    | Behavior                                                                             |

| Partial  | Missing rating/skills/city: omit that fragment, do not fake `5.0` or surveying chips |
| Disabled | None on the card                                                                     |
| Error    | Card-level errors do not exist; list error is the parent                             |
| Loading  | Skeleton cards in the parent list                                                    |
| Empty    | Parent empty state                                                                   |

Do not use `/resume.html` or placeholder names as fallbacks.

## Review submission

**NEEDS CONFIRMATION.** Not a Phase 1 flow.

If later confirmed, minimum states to design (do not implement now):

| State           | Note                                                                                    |

| Success         | List refresh; close dialog                                                              |

| Legal           | Links to `/terms` and `/privacy-policy`, not `#`                                        |

Home testimonials vs profile reviews: **BUSINESS DECISION REQUIRED**.

Display of ratings on cards/profile remains allowed when the API returns them.

## Quality check

- Loading, empty, error, success, retry exist for search, city, services, profile, each registration step, articles, FAQ, knowledge.
- Registration completion is an explicit success state (legacy had none).
- OTP resend cannot be implemented as navigation to step 3.
- Building-permit empty is included.
- Unconfirmed features are absent, not disabled fakes.
- No backend response shapes invented.
